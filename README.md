# Heart-Disease-prediction-system
Similar to the diabetes prediction system, it uses dataset results to predict whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not.

datasets include:
 - age
 - sex / gender
 - cholesteral
 - chest pain type
 - resting blood pressure
 - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
 - resting electrocardiographic result
 - maximum heart rate achieved
 - exercise induced angina 
 - oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
 - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
 - calcium
 - thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
 

The data is divided in to two groups, training and test data. The training  data is used to train the model through logisitc regression whilst the test data is used to test the accuracy of the model.

the accuracy as of the conducted test at the time of the model is 0.81
